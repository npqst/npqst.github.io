Hello! 

I am a final year DPhil student in the Department for Statistics at the University of Oxford.
My research focuses on developing and applying deep learning methods for T-cell receptor structures. 
I'm part of the [Oxford Protein Informatics Group](https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/), and am supervised by Prof. Charlotte Deane, Dr. Matthew Raybould and Prof. Yee Whye Teh. 

I'm interested in physics-based guidance for deep learning models, and am experienced dealing with low data regimes. I have conducted research in protein structure prediction, uncertainty quantification, and immunoinformatics. As part of my research I have trained Transformers, generative models, graph neural networks and reinforcement learning agents. I also served as President of the [Oxford Wom*n in Computer Science Society](https://www.oxwocs.com/). It would be lovely to hear from you if you're interested in my research. 

Nele
