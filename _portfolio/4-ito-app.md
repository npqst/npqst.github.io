Prototype Application for privacy-preserving contact tracing in pandemic scenarios. This project emerged from a hackathon and led to an international open-source project to promote the development of privacy-preserving contact tracing during the Covid-19 pandemic, rather than relying on centralised databases. A similar protocol to the one we were advocating for was implemented by Apple and Google as the GAEN protocol in the iOS and Android API in April 2020. During the pandemic I pitched the project to the Dutch Health ministry, alongside multi-national software corporations. Ito means thread in japanese.
