This was one of my favourite projects! During my undergraduate degree we built a brain-controlled slot car racing track. This was an engineering design project as part of the second year curriculum of the Bioengineering course at Imperial College. We built a prototype by replacing the classical hand-held controller with a micro-processor that interfaced via bluetooth with a commercial electro-encephalogram (EEG). The EEG monitored the electrical waves emmited by the racer's brain. This allowed users to speed up the car by concentrating (elevating beta waves) and slow the car by meditating or relaxing (elevating alpha waves).
